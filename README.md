# Introduction

These files are my practice for automation testing about website.
I would like to design the testing framework to slove the testing problem.

Idea: [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/) with JAVA + [Grid](http://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/grid/) + [TestNG](http://testng.org/doc/) + data driven testing + [Extentreport](http://extentreports.com/) + log management + screenshot
